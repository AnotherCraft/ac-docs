      - name: size
        type: Vector3F

      - name: contactFriction
        type: Vector3F
        default: 30
        description: Friction the collider applies on contact with other colliders, separate for each direction.

      - name: rayCastOnly
        type: bool
        default: false
        description: If set to true, the collider does not provide physical collision, but only makes the collider pickable by mouse (ray cast) -> the block can be interacted with/damaged through the collider.
