# AnotherCraft API specification
This specification aims to unify interfaces across the client, server and blockchain implementations to make it possible later on to create mods that can run on both server and client using the same codebase.

The API documentation is categorized into these folders:
* **Game**: Game-global objects (consistent across multiple worlds)
* **World**: World-related objects â€“ chunks, acessing blocks in the world, ...
* **Block**: Defining block types and their behaviour
* **Inventory**
* **Item**
