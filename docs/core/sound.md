# Sound effects

- AnotherCraft has the Soloud (https://solhsa.com/soloud/) audio engine implemented. There are a few basic lame sounds added in the game.
- **Audio effects change based on the environment.** When you’re inside caves, you hear reverb. When you go into a wool-surrounded room, everything’s muffled.
